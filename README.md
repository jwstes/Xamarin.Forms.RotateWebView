Working with WebView
==============
This repo demonstrates how to use a webview with a custom renderer in Xamarin Forms. It is based off of Craig Dunn's code. You can find the link below. 
When the device rotates, the frame properly resizes. Is this only an iOS solution.



Below is the origin readme.
These samples relate to the [Working with WebView in Xamarin.Forms](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/xamarin-forms/working-with/webview) doc.
